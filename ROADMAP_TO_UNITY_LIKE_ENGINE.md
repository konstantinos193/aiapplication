📅 Realistic Timeline

Months 1-2: GUI enhancements, basic scene system.
Months 3-4: Asset pipeline, AI-generated assets.
Months 5-6: Visual scripting, component editors.
Months 7-9: Advanced tools (materials, animations, terrain).
Months 10-11: VR/AR, collaboration, polish.
Total: ~11 months for full feature set.


🤔 Alternative Approaches
If scope is too large:

Start with a 2D editor (simpler rendering, assets).
Use an existing engine’s editor (e.g., Godot) as a base.
Focus on AI-driven asset generation first.
Limit to specific tools (e.g., level editor only).


💡 Why This Matters
Nexlify will transform from a developer-only tool to a content creation platform for artists, designers, and coders, with AI automating complex tasks like code and asset generation. This is akin to building Unity’s editor from scratch, with the added power of AI-driven development.
