```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nexlify.git
cd nexlify

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the engine
python main.py
```

### 2. Creating Your First Scene
```python
from src.core.engine import GameEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = GameEngine()
engine.initialize()

# Create a scene
scene = engine.create_scene("My First Scene")
engine.load_scene("My First Scene")

# Add objects to the scene
cube = engine.create_cube("My Cube")
cube.transform.set_position(0, 0, 0)

# Add a camera
camera = engine.create_camera("Main Camera")
camera.transform.set_position(0, 5, 10)

# Start the engine
engine.start()
```

### 3. AI Asset Generation
```python
from src.ai.ai_manager import AIManager

# Initialize AI manager
ai_manager = AIManager()
ai_manager.initialize({})

# Generate a texture
result = ai_manager.generate_texture(
    prompt="rusty metal surface",
    width=512,
    height=512,
    texture_type="noise"
)

if result.success:
    print(f"Generated texture: {result.asset_path}")
```
