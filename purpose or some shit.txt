1. Core MVP:

AI chat interface for command input.

Generation of 3D objects and their placement in interactive scenes.

Basic game logic scripting (movement, collision, interactions).

Simple viewport to preview and play the scene in real-time.



2. Modules:

Prompt Parsing:

Understand natural language instructions.

Translate commands to engine-specific actions.

Validate commands and handle ambiguous input.


3D & Game Asset Generation:

Generate 3D models (.obj, .glb) with AI.

Create textures, materials, and shaders.

Optimize meshes for real-time performance.


Scene & World Composition:

Place objects with position, rotation, and scale.

Set up lights, cameras, and environmental effects.

Implement physics objects, collisions, and constraints.

Handle terrain, skyboxes, and background elements.


Game Logic / Scripting:

AI generates code for object behaviors.

Event triggers (e.g., on collision, on click).

NPC behaviors and AI scripting.

Story events, dialogue, and branching paths.


Visuals & Rendering:

Apply shaders, lighting effects, and materials.

Integrate animations and particle systems.

Implement post-processing (bloom, shadows, reflections).

Optimize frame rate and rendering performance.




3. Tech Stack 

Python for scripting and AI command integration.

Blender or PyThreeJS for 3D asset generation.

AI APIs (like OpenAI, Point-E, DreamFusion) for text-to-3D and text-to-code.

Local or cloud runtime for game testing and rendering.

Optional integration with web frameworks for online sharing.



4. Next steps

Define all AI commands the engine will recognize.

Create a command parser that maps language input to engine actions.

Implement basic object generation (cube, sphere, plane).

Add AI-assisted placement and object grouping.

Create simple physics integration (gravity, collisions).

Implement a minimal scripting system for object behavior.

AI-generated story elements and event triggers.

Develop a viewport for real-time preview and basic interactivity.

Expand asset generation: advanced shapes, textures, shaders.

Integrate lighting, environmental effects, and cameras.

Add more complex physics and animation capabilities.

Expand AI to generate code for NPC behaviors, quests, and interactions.

Optimize scene performance for larger environments.

Add saving/loading of scenes and game states.

Test and iterate user input handling and AI interpretation.

Plan modular expansion for multiplayer, online features, or advanced rendering.




The goal is to have a system where you describe a game scene or mechanics, and the AI builds a fully interactive game with all elements integrated.
